# Contributing

- For bugs, open an issue with 3.3.5a client details and steps to reproduce.
- For features, propose first via an issue.
- Keep code Wrath-safe (no Retail-only APIs, no `SetColorTexture`).
- Use unique prefixes (`EpochAM_`) to avoid conflicts and taint.
- Test with `/console scriptErrors 1`.
